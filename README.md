Your guide through the complexities of software projects. A curated playbook of principles, checklists, and strategies for senior engineers and tech leads.

## Project Kick-off

### Project Kick-off: Core Questions

* [ ] **Cloud & Account:** Which provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)? Existing client account or new?
* [ ] **Authentication & Authorization:** What is the primary auth model for cloud services? (e.g., IAM Roles, Service Accounts).

## Core Collaboration Principles

* **Sprint Commitment**
    Tasks committed to a sprint must be completed by its end. This requires realistic planning, breaking down work properly, and flagging risks early to ensure predictable delivery.

* **Asynchronous-First Communication**
    We communicate asynchronously to protect focus time. Do not expect immediate replies; we respond as soon as we are able. Plan your work accordingly and provide full context in your initial message to make this effective.

* **Ownership and Action**
    Issues and setbacks are normal in development. When you discover a problem, convert complaints into action by creating a task so it can be tracked, prioritized, and solved.

## Good coding practices

* Instantly update the changelog with new information.
* Use [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) to model an architecture. You can draw blueprints in [structurizr](https://structurizr.com/).
* Use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for all graphs and flowcharts.
* [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)
  * Write extensible code, but only add the functionalities needed now.
* If your changes are not ready to be submitted at the end of your work day, make a dirty branch, commit all of your changes to it (typically git commit -am'WIP') and push it to a remote.
* TDD works only when you fully understand the problem and interface. Building a thing is a good way to explore.
* You should set up a clear naming convention at the beginning of your project and stick to it. 

## Daily Toolkit

### Productivity

* [Nozbe](https://get.nozbe.com/przemyslawsagalo3) - It serves as the primary source of truth for my family‚Äôs tasks and my own.
* [brain.fm](brain.fm/invite/19r6Zjg9rx) - Music to focus

### AI tools
* [Google Gemini](g.co/g1referral/DVG30VZB) - Similar to Chat GPT but developed by Google. Its full integration with Google Workspace is a significant advantage, allowing users access to both services for one fee.
